        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
                <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup yellow onion diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup green bell pepper diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
                <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese shredded</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425Â°F and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Divide pizza dough into 4 equal parts and roll each dough ball into a 1/4 inch thick circle.</li>
                <li>On half of each dough circle, add equal parts sauce, yellow onion, green bell pepper, and sliced pepperoni. Make sure to leave a little room around the edges so you can crimp the calzone shut.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the toppings with equal parts shredded cheese. Then fold the other half of the dough over the toppings and crimp the edges.</li>
                <li>Cut 2-3 air vents into the top of the calzone and place it on to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Brush with olive oil and bake for about 15 minutes or until the dough is fully cooked and the calzone is golden brown.</li>
                <li>Serve with warmed pizza sauce for dipping.</li>
            </ol>
